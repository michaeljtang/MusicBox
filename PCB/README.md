# Music Box PCB

This folder includes all files necessary to manufacture a PCB for my electronic music box project. More specifically, the PCB created is intended to host all components (or connectors to components, if they are too big) necessary for the music box to run. 

In addition to a Bill-of-Materials and and PCB Schematic, this directory contains the following folders:

### /EAGLE
This folder contains the Eagle files of my PCB, and include schematic, board, as well as a library with all parts used.

### /MFG
This folder contains all the Gerber manufacturing files needed to actually manufacture my PCB

### /docs
This folder contains images of the top and bottom views of my PCB (taken from Gerber files).
